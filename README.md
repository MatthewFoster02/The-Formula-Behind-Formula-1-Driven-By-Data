# The Formula Behind Formula 1 - Driven By Data

### This is a Data Madness project for the Data Analysis course (KEN3450) at [Maastricht University](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/)

Using the [Ergast Developer API](http://ergast.com/mrd/) we are setting out to analyse 3 primary questions:
  1) Does experience in Formula 1 correlate to the frequency of accidents for a driver?
  2) At which circuits is qualifying more important to the finishing position?
  3) Does the altitude of the circuit affect the number of mechanical failures?

### More details on the project will be added later...
